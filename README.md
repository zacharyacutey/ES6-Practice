# ES6-Practice
This project was not originally mine.  V1 of this is technically the second version of the project.  The project was originally made by someone else and had bugs in it, so I fixed them.  Then for V2, I refactored the code using ES6 classes.  From there I just added features.

# Features and additions

V1: Just a bug-free version of someone else's project

V2: Refactor code using ES6 classes

V3: Allow user to change ball color

V4: (not finished; buggy) an attempt to allow the user to decide how many people will play.
